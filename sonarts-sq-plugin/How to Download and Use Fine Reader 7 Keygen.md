Moreover, a keygen may not work properly or may contain hidden code that can damage your software or hardware. For example, a keygen may corrupt your files, delete your data, disable your antivirus, or lock your computer. A keygen may also trigger an alert from ABBYY or other software vendors that can detect illegal copies of their products.
 
## Why Using a Fine Reader 7 Keygen is Unethical
